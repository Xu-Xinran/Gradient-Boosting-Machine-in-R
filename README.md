# Gradient-Boosting-Machine-in-R

This studay uses R and data from Capital Bikeshare available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository to explore bike rentals from 2011 to 2012 in Washington, D.C. 

The model used in the study is GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine).
We were curious what influenced people renting bikes over the course of the year.
